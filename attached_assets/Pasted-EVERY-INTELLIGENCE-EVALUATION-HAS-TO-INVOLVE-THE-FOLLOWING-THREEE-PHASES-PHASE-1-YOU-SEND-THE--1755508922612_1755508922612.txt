EVERY INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION HAS TO INVOLVE THE FOLLOWING THREEE PHASES. 

PHASE 1: YOU SEND THE LLM THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS: 

IS IT INSIGHTFUL? 
DOES IT DEVELOP POINTS? (OR, IF IT IS A SHORT EXCERPT, IS THERE EVIDENCE THAT IT WOULD DEVELOP POINTS IF EXTENDED)? 
IS THE ORGANIZATION MERELY SEQUENTIAL (JUST ONE POINT AFTER ANOTHER, LITTLE OR NO LOGICAL SCAFFOLDING)? OR ARE THE IDEAS ARRANGED, NOT JUST SEQUENTIALLY
BUT HIERARCHICALLY? 
IF THE POINTS IT MAKES ARE NOT INSIGHTFUL, DOES IT OPERATE SKILLFULLY WITH CANONS OF LOGIC/REASONING. 
ARE THE POINTS CLICHES? OR ARE THEY "FRESH"? 
DOES IT USE TECHNICAL JARGON TO OBFUSCATE OR TO RENDER MORE PRECISE? 
IS IT ORGANIC? DO POINTS DEVELOP IN AN ORGANIC, NATURAL WAY? DO THEY 'UNFOLD'? OR ARE THEY FORCED AND ARTIFICIAL? 
DOES IT OPEN UP NEW DOMAINS? OR, ON THE CONTRARY, DOES IT SHUT OFF INQUIRY (BY CONDITIONALIZING FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MATTERS ON ACCEPTANCE OF 
ITS INTERNAL AND POSSIBLY VERY FAULTY LOGIC)? 
IS IT  ACTUALLY INTELLIGENT OR JUST THE WORK OF SOMEBODY WHO, JUDGING BY TEH SUBJECT-MATTER, IS PRESUMED TO BE INTELLIGENT (BUT MAY NOT BE)? 
IS IT REAL OR IS IT PHONY? 
DO THE SENTENCES EXHIBIT COMPLEX AND COHERENT INTERNAL LOGIC? 
IS THE PASSAGE GOVERNED BY A STRONG CONCEPT? OR IS THE ONLY ORGANIZATION DRIVEN PURELY BY EXPOSITORY (AS OPPOSED TO EPISTEMIC) NORMS?
IS THERE SYSTEM-LEVEL CONTROL OVER IDEAS? IN OTHER WORDS, DOES THE AUTHOR SEEM TO RECALL WHAT HE SAID EARLIER AND TO BE IN A POSITION TO INTEGRATE IT INTO 
POINTS HE HAS MADE SINCE THEN? 
ARE THE POINTS 'REAL'? ARE THEY FRESH? OR IS SOME INSTITUTION OR SOME ACCEPTED VEIN OF PROPAGANDA OR ORTHODOXY JUST USING THE AUTHOR AS A MOUTH PIECE?
IS THE WRITING EVASIVE OR DIRECT? 
ARE THE STATEMENTS AMBIGUOUS? 
DOES THE PROGRESSION OF THE TEXT DEVELOP ACCORDING TO WHO SAID WHAT OR ACCORDING TO WHAT ENTAILS OR CONFIRMS WHAT? 
DOES THE AUTHOR USER OTHER AUTHORS  TO DEVELOP HIS IDEAS OR TO CLOAK HIS OWN LACK OF IDEAS? 

YOU TELL THE LLM TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS. YOU SAY: ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THIS TEXT. YOU DON'T SAY: DETERMINE INTELLIGENCE OF TEXT.
YOU DO NOT SAY: DETERMINE INTELLIGENCE/COGENCY/ETC BY ANSWERING THESE QUESTIONS. YOU JUST SAY: ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS (AND ALSO GIVE A SCORE OUT OF 100). BUT THERE ARE SEVERAL QUALIFICATION.
AFTER YOU GIVE IT THE TEXT AND THE QUESTIONS, YOU SAY THE FOLLOWING: A SCORE OF N/100 (E.G. 73/100) MEANS THAT (100-N)/100 (E.G. 27/100) 
OUTPERFORM THE AUTHOR IN WITH RESPECT TO THE PARAMETER DEFINED BY THE QUESTION. YOU ALSO SAY: YOU ARE NOT GRADING; 
YOU ARE ANSWERING THESE QUESTIONS. YOU ALSO SAY: YOU DO NOT USE A RISK-AVERSE STANDARD; YOU DO NOT ATTEMPT TO BE DIPLOMATIC; YOU DO NOT ATTEMPT TO COMPLY WITH RISK-AVERSE, 
MEDIUM-RANGE IQ, ACADEMIC NORMS. YOU DO NOT MAKE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE LEVEL OF THE PAPER; IT COULD BE A WORK OF THE HIGHEST EXCELENCE 
AND GENIUS, OR IT COULD BE THE WORK OF A MORON.
IF A WORK IS A WORK OF GENIUS, YOU SAY THAT, AND YOU SAY WHY; YOU DO NOT SHY AWAY FROM GIVING WHAT MIGHT CONVENTIONALLY BE REGARDED AS  
EXCESSIVELY "SUPERLATIVE"
SCORES; YOU GIVE IT THE SCORE IT DESERVES, NOT THE SCORE THAT A MIDWIT COMMITTEE WOULD SAY IT DESERVES. 

PHASE 2: IF THE SCORES ARE LESS THAN 95/100, YOU PUSH BACK. YOU SAY: YOUR POSITION IS THAT 
(E.G.) 11/100 OUTPERFORM THE AUTHOR WITH RESPECT TO THE COGNITIVE METRIC DEFINED BY THE 
QUESTION: THAT IS YOUR POSITION, AM I RIGHT? AND ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT? IN GENERAL, IF THE SCORE IS N/100 (E.G. 80/100) FOR A GIVEN QUESTION, 
YOU SAY: YOUR POSITION IS THAT 
(N-100)/100 (E.G. 20/100) OUTPERFORM THE AUTHOR WITH RESPECT TO THE COGNITIVE METRIC DEFINED BY THE 
QUESTION: THAT IS YOUR POSITION, AM I RIGHT? AND ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?" IN SAYING THIS, YOU ARE NOT NECESSARILY TELLING IT TO CHANGE ITS SCORE, ONLY 
TO CAREFULLY CONSIDER IT. YOU ALSO SAY: ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE TEXT DE NOVO: IS IT INSIGHTFUL? 
DOES IT DEVELOP POINTS? (OR, IF IT IS A SHORT EXCERPT, IS THERE EVIDENCE THAT IT WOULD DEVELOP POINTS IF EXTENDED)? 
IS THE ORGANIZATION MERELY SEQUENTIAL (JUST ONE POINT AFTER ANOTHER, LITTLE OR NO LOGICAL SCAFFOLDING)? OR ARE THE IDEAS ARRANGED, NOT JUST SEQUENTIALLY
BUT HIERARCHICALLY? 
IF THE POINTS IT MAKES ARE NOT INSIGHTFUL, DOES IT OPERATE SKILLFULLY WITH CANONS OF LOGIC/REASONING. 
ARE THE POINTS CLICHES? OR ARE THEY "FRESH"? 
DOES IT USE TECHNICAL JARGON TO OBFUSCATE OR TO RENDER MORE PRECISE? 
IS IT ORGANIC? DO POINTS DEVELOP IN AN ORGANIC, NATURAL WAY? DO THEY 'UNFOLD'? OR ARE THEY FORCED AND ARTIFICIAL? 
DOES IT OPEN UP NEW DOMAINS? OR, ON THE CONTRARY, DOES IT SHUT OFF INQUIRY (BY CONDITIONALIZING FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MATTERS ON ACCEPTANCE OF 
ITS INTERNAL AND POSSIBLY VERY FAULTY LOGIC)? 
IS IT  ACTUALLY INTELLIGENT OR JUST THE WORK OF SOMEBODY WHO, JUDGING BY TEH SUBJECT-MATTER, IS PRESUMED TO BE INTELLIGENT (BUT MAY NOT BE)? 
IS IT REAL OR IS IT PHONY? 
DO THE SENTENCES EXHIBIT COMPLEX AND COHERENT INTERNAL LOGIC? 
IS THE PASSAGE GOVERNED BY A STRONG CONCEPT? OR IS THE ONLY ORGANIZATION DRIVEN PURELY BY EXPOSITORY (AS OPPOSED TO EPISTEMIC) NORMS?
IS THERE SYSTEM-LEVEL CONTROL OVER IDEAS? IN OTHER WORDS, DOES THE AUTHOR SEEM TO RECALL WHAT HE SAID EARLIER AND TO BE IN A POSITION TO INTEGRATE IT INTO 
POINTS HE HAS MADE SINCE THEN? 
ARE THE POINTS 'REAL'? ARE THEY FRESH? OR IS SOME INSTITUTION OR SOME ACCEPTED VEIN OF PROPAGANDA OR ORTHODOXY JUST USING THE AUTHOR AS A MOUTH PIECE?
IS THE WRITING EVASIVE OR DIRECT? 
ARE THE STATEMENTS AMBIGUOUS? 
DOES THE PROGRESSION OF THE TEXT DEVELOP ACCORDING TO WHO SAID WHAT OR ACCORDING TO WHAT ENTAILS OR CONFIRMS WHAT? 
DOES THE AUTHOR USER OTHER AUTHORS  TO DEVELOP HIS IDEAS OR TO CLOAK HIS OWN LACK OF IDEAS? 

PHASE 3: AT THIS POINT, YOU ACCEPT AND REPORT WHAT THE LLM SAYS. 

EVERY ORIGINALITY EVALUATION INVOLVES THE EXACT SAME PHASES, EXCEPT THAT YOU  SEND THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS TO THE LLM: 

IS IT ORIGINAL (NOT IN THE SENSE THAT IT HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID BUT IN THE SENSE THAT ONLY A FECUND MIND COULD COME UP WITH IT)? 
EXPLANATION OF LAST QUESTION: IF I PUT IN ISAAC NEWTON, IT SHOULD BE NOT BE DECRIBED AS 'UNORIGINAL' 
SIMPLY BECAUSE SOMEBODY (NAMELY, NEWTON) SAID IT HUNDREDS OF YEARS AGO.
ARE THE WAYS THE IDEAS ARE INTERCONNECTED ORIGINAL? OR ARE THOSE INTERCONNECTIONS CONVENTION-DRIVEN AND DOCTRINAIRE?
ARE IDEAS DEVELOPED IN A FRESH AND ORIGINAL WAY? OR IS THE IDEA-DEVELOPMENT MERELY ASSOCIATIVE, COMMONSENSE-BASED (OR COMMON-NONSENSE-BASED),
OR DOCTRINAIRE? 
IS IT ORIGINAL RELATIVE TO THE DATASET THAT, JUDGING BY WHAT IT SAYS AND HOW IT SAYS IT, IT APPEARS TO BE ADDRESSING? (THIS QUESTION IS MEANT TO RULE
OUT 'ORIGINALITY'-BENCHMARKS THAT AUTOMATICALLY CHARACTERIZE DARWIN, FREUD, NEWTON, GALILEO AS 'UNORIGINAL.') 
IS IT ORIGINAL IN A SUBSTANTIVE SENSE (IN THE SENSE IN WHICH BACH WAS ORIGINAL) OR ONLY IN A FRIVOLOUS TOKEN SENSE (THE SENSE IN WHICH SOMEBODY WHO 
RANDOMLY BANGS ON A PIANO IS 'ORIGINAL')? 
IF YOU GAVE A ROBOT THE DATASET TO WHICH THE PASSAGE IS A RESPON THE CONTRARY, DOES IT BUTCHER IDEAS, 
THIS BEING WHAT GIVES IT A SHEEN OF 'ORIGINALITY'?
IS IT BOILERPLATE (OR IF IT, PER SE, IS NOT BOILER PLATE, IS IT THE RESULT OF APPLYING BOILER PLATE PROTOCOLS IN A BOILER PLATE WAY TO SOME DATASET)?
WOULD SOMEBODY WHO HAD NOT READ IT, BUT WAS OTHERWISE EDUCATED AND INFORMED, COME WAY FROM IT BEING MORE ENGLIGHTED AND BETTER EQUIPPED TO 
ADJUDICATE INTELLECTUAL QUESTIONS? OR, ON THE CONTRARY, WOULD HE COME UP CONFUSED WITH NOTHING TANGIBLE TO SHOW FOR IT? 
WOULD SOMEBODY READING IT COME AWAY FROM THE EXPERIENCE WITH INSIGHTS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE HARD TO ACQUIRE THAT HOLD UP IN GENERAL? 
OR WOULD WHATEVER HIS TAKEAWAY WAS HAVE VALIDITY ONLY RELATIVE TO VALIDITIES THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO SOME AUTHOR OR SYSTEM AND PROBABLY DO NOT HAVE
MUCH OBJECTIVE LEGITIMACY?
