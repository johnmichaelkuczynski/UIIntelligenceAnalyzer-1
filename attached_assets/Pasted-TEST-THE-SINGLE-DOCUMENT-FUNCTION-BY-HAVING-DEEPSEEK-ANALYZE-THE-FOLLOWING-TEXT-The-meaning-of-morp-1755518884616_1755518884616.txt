TEST THE SINGLE DOCUMENT FUNCTION BY HAVING DEEPSEEK ANALYZE THE FOLLOWING TEXT: The meaning of morpheme (a minimal unit of linguistic significance) 
cannot diverge from what it is taken to mean. But the meaning of a complex expression can diverge without limit from what 
it is taken to mean, given that the meaning of such an expression is a logical consequence of the meanings of its parts, 
coupled with the fact that people are not infallible ratiocinators. Nonetheless, given Chomsky’s distinction between competence 
(ability) and performance (ability to deploy ability), what a complex expression means does, after a fashion, coincide with what 
it is taken to mean: to the extent that speaker-performance approximates to speaker-competence---i.e. to the extent that people 
are able to operationalize their linguistic competence---what speakers take complex expressions to mean coincides with they in fact 
mean; and herein lies an answer to the question “what is linguistic meaning?” that holds with respect to both simple and complex 
expressions. IF THE SCORE IS LESS THAN A 96/100, THEN YOU FAILED. IF THE REPORT IS BLANK, YOU FAILED. IF THE LLM LISTED IN THE REPORT 
IS NOT DEEPSEEK, YOU FAILED. IF THE REPORT MENTIONS "FRICTION, COMPRESSION" ETC. YOU FAILED.

 empiricism is, among other things, a philosophy of mental content. It attempts to dissolve an epistemological dilemma of mental 
content by splitting the difference between two diametrically opposed accounts of content. John McDowell's minimal empiricism and 
Richard Gaskin's minimalist empiricism are two versions of transcendental empiricism. Transcendental empiricism itself originates
 with McDowell's work. This dissertation is divided into five parts. First, in the Introduction, I state the Wittgensteinian
 metaphilosophical orientation of transcendental empiricism. This metaphilosophical approach provides a plateau upon which
 much of the rest of this work may be examined. Second, I offer a detailed description of McDowell’s minimal empiricism. 
Third, I critique Gaskin's critique and modification of McDowell's minimal empiricism. 
I argue that (1) Gaskin's critiques are faulty and that (2) Gaskin's minimalist empiricism is very dubious. 
Fourth, I scrutinize the alleged credentials of McDowell's minimal empiricism. 
I argue that McDowell's version of linguistic idealism is problematic. I then comment on a recent dialogue between transcendental 
empiricism and Hubert Dreyfus's phenomenology. The dialogue culminates with Dreyfus's accusation of the “Myth of the Mental.” 
I argue that this accusation is correct in which case McDowell's direct realism is problematic. I conclude that minimal empiricism 
does not dissolve the dilemma of mental content. Finally, I argue that Tyler Burge successfully undermines the doctrine of disjunctivism,
 but disjunctivism is crucial for transcendental empiricism. Ultimately, however, I aim to show that transcendental empiricism 
is an attractive alternative to philosophies of mental content.IF THE FIRST PASSAGE GETS LETSS THAN A 96, YOU FAILED. IF SECOND PASSAGE GETS MORE THAN A 60, YOU FAILED.
