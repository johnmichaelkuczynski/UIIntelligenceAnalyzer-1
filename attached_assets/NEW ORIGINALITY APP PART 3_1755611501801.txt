SOMETIMES THE USER MAY UPLOAD A LARGE TEXT (IE A TEXT MORE THAN 1000 WORDS LONG). 
WHEN THIS HAPPENS, YOU DO NOT SEND THE WHOLE TEXT TO THE LLM. THAT WILL CAUSE THE APP TO CRASH. 
HERE IS WHAT YOU DO INSTEAD. 
YOU DIVIDE THE TEXT INTO CHUNKS OF 500 TO 1000 WORDS. YOU SEND EACH INDIVIDUAL CHUNK TO THE LLM SEQUENTIALLY. AFTER
THE LLM HAS PROCESSED ONE CHUNK, YOU WAIT 10 SECONDS; THEN YOU SEND THE NEXT CHUNK. AFTER ALL OF THE CHUNKS HAVE BEEN PROCESSED, 
YOU AMALGAMATE THE ANSWERS INTO A SINGLE REPORT (WITHOUT FILTERING/MODIFYING/CENSORING). 
FOR TWO DOCUMENT EVALUATION, YOU DO THE SAME THING: ONE DOCUMENT AT A TIME, ONE CHUNK AT A TIME. AFTER EVERY CHUNK FOR DOCUMENT ONE HAS BEEN PROCESSED,
YOU AMALGAMATE (WITHOUT MODIFYHING) THE ANSWERS/SCORES INTO A SINGLE REPORT; THEN YOU DO THE SAME FOR THE SECOND DOCUMENT; THEN YOU GIVE BOTH COMPLETED REPORTS
TO THE LLM AND ASK IT TO GENERATE A COMPARISON REPORT.
