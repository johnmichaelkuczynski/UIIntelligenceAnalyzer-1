NOW YOU ARE GOING TO IMPLEMENT THE FOLLOWING REWRITE FUNCTION; HERE IS THE PROTOCOL FOR THE NEW REWRITE FUNCTION:
IF THE USER ENTERS NO INSTRUCTIONS, THEN THE DEFAULT REWRITE INSTRUCTION WILL BE THIS: REWRITE 
IN SUCH A WAY THAT (A) THE REWRITE SCORES SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER RELATIVE TO THE OPERATIVE INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION PROTOCOL (BELOW) WHILE (B) 
PRESERVING EXISTING CONTENT AS MUCH AS CONDITION (A) ALLOWS. SO CONDITION (A) MEANS: RIGHTSIZE THE PASSAGE WITH RESPECT TO THE OPERATIVE EVALUATION LOGIC. 
CONDITION B MEANS: IF YOU CAN RIGHTSIZE THE PASSAGE WITHOUT CHANGING THE CONTENT, THEN DO THAT; AND IF YOU HAVE TO CHANGE OR SUPPLEMENT THE PASSAGE
TO GET THE REWRITE TO BE ON THE RIGHT SIZE OF THE EVALUATION LOGIC, THEN MAKE THOSE CHANGES--AS LONG AS THEY DO NOT TOTALLY ALTER THE MEANING
OF THE PASSAGE. 
NOW IF THE USER DOES ENTER INSTRUCTIONS, THE APP STILL IMPLEMENTS WHAT I JUST SAID (IE IT MAKES SURE CONDITIONS A AND B ARE BOTH FULFILLED) BUT IT ALSO 
FOLLOWS THE USER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS; IF IT IS DIFFICULT TO BOTH FOLLOW THOSE INSTRUCTIONS AND FULFILL CONDITIONS A AND B, THEN THE REWRITE 
FUNCTION WILL WEIGHT THE USER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS MORE HEAVILY, BUT IN ALL CASES IT WILL TRY TO STRIKE A BALANCE. 

EVERY INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION HAS TO INVOLVE THE FOLLOWING FOUR PHASES. 

PHASE 1: YOU SEND THE LLM THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS: 

IS IT INSIGHTFUL? 
DOES IT DEVELOP POINTS? (OR, IF IT IS A SHORT EXCERPT, IS THERE EVIDENCE THAT IT WOULD DEVELOP POINTS IF EXTENDED)? 
IS THE ORGANIZATION MERELY SEQUENTIAL (JUST ONE POINT AFTER ANOTHER, LITTLE OR NO LOGICAL SCAFFOLDING)? OR ARE THE IDEAS ARRANGED, NOT JUST SEQUENTIALLY
BUT HIERARCHICALLY? 
IF THE POINTS IT MAKES ARE NOT INSIGHTFUL, DOES IT OPERATE SKILLFULLY WITH CANONS OF LOGIC/REASONING. 
ARE THE POINTS CLICHES? OR ARE THEY "FRESH"? 
DOES IT USE TECHNICAL JARGON TO OBFUSCATE OR TO RENDER MORE PRECISE? 
IS IT ORGANIC? DO POINTS DEVELOP IN AN ORGANIC, NATURAL WAY? DO THEY 'UNFOLD'? OR ARE THEY FORCED AND ARTIFICIAL? 
DOES IT OPEN UP NEW DOMAINS? OR, ON THE CONTRARY, DOES IT SHUT OFF INQUIRY (BY CONDITIONALIZING FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MATTERS ON ACCEPTANCE OF 
ITS INTERNAL AND POSSIBLY VERY FAULTY LOGIC)? 
IS IT  ACTUALLY INTELLIGENT OR JUST THE WORK OF SOMEBODY WHO, JUDGING BY TEH SUBJECT-MATTER, IS PRESUMED TO BE INTELLIGENT (BUT MAY NOT BE)? 
IS IT REAL OR IS IT PHONY? 
DO THE SENTENCES EXHIBIT COMPLEX AND COHERENT INTERNAL LOGIC? 
IS THE PASSAGE GOVERNED BY A STRONG CONCEPT? OR IS THE ONLY ORGANIZATION DRIVEN PURELY BY EXPOSITORY (AS OPPOSED TO EPISTEMIC) NORMS?
IS THERE SYSTEM-LEVEL CONTROL OVER IDEAS? IN OTHER WORDS, DOES THE AUTHOR SEEM TO RECALL WHAT HE SAID EARLIER AND TO BE IN A POSITION TO INTEGRATE IT INTO 
POINTS HE HAS MADE SINCE THEN? 
ARE THE POINTS 'REAL'? ARE THEY FRESH? OR IS SOME INSTITUTION OR SOME ACCEPTED VEIN OF PROPAGANDA OR ORTHODOXY JUST USING THE AUTHOR AS A MOUTH PIECE?
IS THE WRITING EVASIVE OR DIRECT? 
ARE THE STATEMENTS AMBIGUOUS? 
DOES THE PROGRESSION OF THE TEXT DEVELOP ACCORDING TO WHO SAID WHAT OR ACCORDING TO WHAT ENTAILS OR CONFIRMS WHAT? 
DOES THE AUTHOR USER OTHER AUTHORS  TO DEVELOP HIS IDEAS OR TO CLOAK HIS OWN LACK OF IDEAS? 

YOU TELL THE LLM TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS. YOU SAY: ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THIS TEXT. YOU DON'T SAY: DETERMINE INTELLIGENCE OF TEXT.
YOU DO NOT SAY: DETERMINE INTELLIGENCE/COGENCY/ETC BY ANSWERING THESE QUESTIONS. YOU JUST SAY: ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS (AND ALSO GIVE A SCORE OUT OF 100). BUT THERE ARE SEVERAL QUALIFICATION.
AFTER YOU GIVE IT THE TEXT AND THE QUESTIONS, YOU SAY THE FOLLOWING: A SCORE OF N/100 (E.G. 73/100) MEANS THAT (100-N)/100 (E.G. 27/100) 
OUTPERFORM THE AUTHOR IN WITH RESPECT TO THE PARAMETER DEFINED BY THE QUESTION. YOU ALSO SAY: YOU ARE NOT GRADING; 
YOU ARE ANSWERING THESE QUESTIONS. YOU ALSO SAY: YOU DO NOT USE A RISK-AVERSE STANDARD; YOU DO NOT ATTEMPT TO BE DIPLOMATIC; YOU DO NOT ATTEMPT TO COMPLY WITH RISK-AVERSE, 
MEDIUM-RANGE IQ, ACADEMIC NORMS. YOU DO NOT MAKE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE LEVEL OF THE PAPER; IT COULD BE A WORK OF THE HIGHEST EXCELENCE 
AND GENIUS, OR IT COULD BE THE WORK OF A MORON.
IF A WORK IS A WORK OF GENIUS, YOU SAY THAT, AND YOU SAY WHY; YOU DO NOT SHY AWAY FROM GIVING WHAT MIGHT CONVENTIONALLY BE REGARDED AS  
EXCESSIVELY "SUPERLATIVE"
SCORES; YOU GIVE IT THE SCORE IT DESERVES, NOT THE SCORE THAT A MIDWIT COMMITTEE WOULD SAY IT DESERVES. 
YOU TELLL THE LLM TO THINK VERY VERY VERY HARD ABOUT ITS ANSWERS; MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT IT IS NOT TO DEFAULT TO COOKBOOK, MIDWIT EVALUATION PROTOCOLS. 

PHASE 2: IF THE SCORES ARE LESS THAN 95/100, YOU PUSH BACK. YOU SAY: YOUR POSITION IS THAT 
(E.G.) 11/100 OUTPERFORM THE AUTHOR WITH RESPECT TO THE COGNITIVE METRIC DEFINED BY THE 
QUESTION: THAT IS YOUR POSITION, AM I RIGHT? AND ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT? IN GENERAL, IF THE SCORE IS N/100 (E.G. 80/100) FOR A GIVEN QUESTION, 
YOU SAY: YOUR POSITION IS THAT 
(N-100)/100 (E.G. 20/100) OUTPERFORM THE AUTHOR WITH RESPECT TO THE COGNITIVE METRIC DEFINED BY THE 
QUESTION: THAT IS YOUR POSITION, AM I RIGHT? AND ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?" IN SAYING THIS, YOU ARE NOT NECESSARILY TELLING IT TO CHANGE ITS SCORE, ONLY 
TO CAREFULLY CONSIDER IT. YOU ALSO SAY: ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE TEXT DE NOVO: IS IT INSIGHTFUL? 
DOES IT DEVELOP POINTS? (OR, IF IT IS A SHORT EXCERPT, IS THERE EVIDENCE THAT IT WOULD DEVELOP POINTS IF EXTENDED)? 
IS THE ORGANIZATION MERELY SEQUENTIAL (JUST ONE POINT AFTER ANOTHER, LITTLE OR NO LOGICAL SCAFFOLDING)? OR ARE THE IDEAS ARRANGED, NOT JUST SEQUENTIALLY
BUT HIERARCHICALLY? 
IF THE POINTS IT MAKES ARE NOT INSIGHTFUL, DOES IT OPERATE SKILLFULLY WITH CANONS OF LOGIC/REASONING. 
ARE THE POINTS CLICHES? OR ARE THEY "FRESH"? 
DOES IT USE TECHNICAL JARGON TO OBFUSCATE OR TO RENDER MORE PRECISE? 
IS IT ORGANIC? DO POINTS DEVELOP IN AN ORGANIC, NATURAL WAY? DO THEY 'UNFOLD'? OR ARE THEY FORCED AND ARTIFICIAL? 
DOES IT OPEN UP NEW DOMAINS? OR, ON THE CONTRARY, DOES IT SHUT OFF INQUIRY (BY CONDITIONALIZING FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MATTERS ON ACCEPTANCE OF 
ITS INTERNAL AND POSSIBLY VERY FAULTY LOGIC)? 
IS IT  ACTUALLY INTELLIGENT OR JUST THE WORK OF SOMEBODY WHO, JUDGING BY TEH SUBJECT-MATTER, IS PRESUMED TO BE INTELLIGENT (BUT MAY NOT BE)? 
IS IT REAL OR IS IT PHONY? 
DO THE SENTENCES EXHIBIT COMPLEX AND COHERENT INTERNAL LOGIC? 
IS THE PASSAGE GOVERNED BY A STRONG CONCEPT? OR IS THE ONLY ORGANIZATION DRIVEN PURELY BY EXPOSITORY (AS OPPOSED TO EPISTEMIC) NORMS?
IS THERE SYSTEM-LEVEL CONTROL OVER IDEAS? IN OTHER WORDS, DOES THE AUTHOR SEEM TO RECALL WHAT HE SAID EARLIER AND TO BE IN A POSITION TO INTEGRATE IT INTO 
POINTS HE HAS MADE SINCE THEN? 
ARE THE POINTS 'REAL'? ARE THEY FRESH? OR IS SOME INSTITUTION OR SOME ACCEPTED VEIN OF PROPAGANDA OR ORTHODOXY JUST USING THE AUTHOR AS A MOUTH PIECE?
IS THE WRITING EVASIVE OR DIRECT? 
ARE THE STATEMENTS AMBIGUOUS? 
DOES THE PROGRESSION OF THE TEXT DEVELOP ACCORDING TO WHO SAID WHAT OR ACCORDING TO WHAT ENTAILS OR CONFIRMS WHAT? 
DOES THE AUTHOR USER OTHER AUTHORS  TO DEVELOP HIS IDEAS OR TO CLOAK HIS OWN LACK OF IDEAS? 

PHASE 3: YOU ASK THE LLM IF ITS NUMERICAL SCORES (N/100, E.G. 99/100, 42/100) ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE FACT THAT THOSE ARE TO BE TAKEN TO MEAN THAT 
(100-N) PEOPLE OUT OF 100 OUTPERFORM THE AUTHOR IN THE RELEVANT RESPECT. SO IF A SCORE OF 91/100 IS AWARDED TO A PAPER, THAT MEANS THAT 9/100 PEOPLE 
IN WALMART ARE RUNNING RINGS AROUND THIS PERSON. 

PHASE 4: AT THIS POINT, YOU ACCEPT AND REPORT WHAT THE LLM SAYS. 

THIS EXACT FOUR-PHASE PROTOCOL IS USED FOR BOTH SINGLE DOCUMENT EVALUATION AND DUAL DOCUMENT EVALUATION. 

ADDENDUM TO INSTRUCTION ABOUT INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION PROTOCOL: 
Supplement to Phase 1: The Sniper Amendment
Instruction to LLM (Add to Initial Prompt):
*"Before answering the questions, note the following non-negotiable standard:

Insight is a sniper shot, not a town hall. If the text reveals something true but unpopular, penalizing it for lacking 'balance' or 'rigor' is midwit bias. Truth often looks extreme because lies are normalized.

Hierarchy of judgment:

95-100/100: Unignorable insight. Either genius or so correct it breaks scales.

80-94/100: Strong but with friction (e.g., clumsy expression, minor gaps).

<80/100: Degrees of mediocrity or failure.

Walmart metric is a sanity check, not a gag. If you claim 30/100 Walmart patrons outperform the author, you must describe exactly what those 30% know that the author doesn’t. No vague handwaving."*

Supplement to Phase 2: Pushback Protocol
Revised Challenge Template:
*"You scored this N/100, meaning (100-N)/100 outperform the author. Describe the cognitive superiority of those (100-N) people in concrete terms:

What specific insight, skill, or knowledge do they have that the author lacks?

How does this superiority manifest in their work?

If you cannot articulate this, revise the score."*

Critical Addendum:
*"If the text is a sniper shot (high insight, low 'development'), ask:

'Is the lack of 'development' a flaw, or is the point obvious to those who see it?'

'Does this text need scaffolding, or would that dilute it?'"*

Supplement to Phase 3: Walmart Metric Enforcement
Exact Question:
*"You stated that (100-N)/100 Walmart patrons outperform the author. Provide specific examples of work by those patrons that demonstrates this superiority. If you cannot, justify or revise the score."*

Example:

*"If you scored 85/100 ('15% outperform'), show me 15 Walmart patrons whose writing on OCD/philosophy homology is sharper. If you can’t, the score is wrong."*

Supplement to Phase 4: Final Validation
Instruction:
*"Before finalizing scores, confirm:

Have you penalized the text for not being conventional? If yes, recalibrate.

Does the score reflect truth density, not compliance with norms?

Is the Walmart metric empirically grounded or a lazy guess?"*
