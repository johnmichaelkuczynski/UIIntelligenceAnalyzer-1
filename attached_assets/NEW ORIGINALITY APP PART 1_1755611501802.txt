YOU ARE GOING TO CREATE AN APP CALLED THE "ORIGINALITY METER". 
IT WILL DETERMINE THE DEGREE OF ORIGINALITY OF TEXTS. IT WILL ALSO COMPARE PAIRS OF TEXTS. 
IT WILL HAVE BOTH "QUICK" AND "COMPREHENSIVE" MODES (DEFINED BELOW). 
QUICK MODE WILL BE THE DEFAULT (SHOULD TAKE AROUND 30 SECONDS FOR ANALYSIS).
THE USER CAN TOGGLE BETWEEN FOUR DIFFERENT LLMS: DEEPSEEK, ANTHROPIC, OPENAI, PERPLEXITY. 
ANTHROPIC WILL BE THE DEFAULT. 
THE APP WILL ALSO EVALUATE INTELLIGENCE/COGENCY/OVERALL QUALITY. 
SO IT WILL HAVE FOUR MODES: ONE FOR INTELLIGENCE, ONE FOR COGENCY, ONE FOR OVERALL QUALITY, ONE FOR ORIGINALITY. 
ORIGINALITY WILL BE THE DEFAULT MODE. 
IT WILL HAVE ALL FOUR MODES FOR EACH LLM; AND IT WILL ALSO HAVE IT FOR BOTH QUICK AND COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSES. 
THE WORK FLOW: 
FOR SINGLE DOCUMENT MODE: USER TYPES OR UPLOADS (TXT/WORD/PDF) TEXT INTO AN INPUT BOX. 
USER THEN CHOOSES WHICH PARAMETER HE WANTS TO EVALUATE (ORIGINALITY/INTELLIGENCE/COGENCY/OVERALLQUALITY). 
THEN THE APP FOLLOWS A PROTOCOL (DESCRIBED IN DETAIL BELOW) AND THEREBY GENERATES AN ASSESSMENT. THIS ASSESSMENT IS DISPLAYED CLEARLY ON THE SCREEN AND
CAN ALSO BE DOWNLOADED AS TXT. 
FOR DOUBLE DOCUMENT: THE SAME AS SINGLE DOCUMENT EXCEPT THAT THERE ARE TWO INPUT BOXES. 

HOW THE APP WORKS: 
THE APP NEVER EVER EVER USES ANY HARDCODED LOGIC. 
THE APP NEVER EVER EVER MODIFIES WHAT THE LLM SAYS. 
THE APP IS JUST A PASSTHROUGH; IT SENDS INFORMATION TO THE LLM AND REPORTS IT. PERIOD. 
HERE IS THE NEXT THING: THE APP NEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER TELLS THE LLM TO "DETERMINE DEGREE OF COGENCY/INTELLIGENCE/ORIGINALITIY/QUALITH". IF T DOES THAT
IT WILL GET SHIT, AND WILL DESTROY THE PURPOSE OF THE APP. 
WHAT THE APP DOES IS VERY SIMPLE: WHEN EVALUATING ORIGINALITY, IT SENDS THE TEXT (OR PAIR OF TEXTS) AND IT ASKS OF THAT TEXT (OR OF EACH TEXT), AND IT 
SAYS: "ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS; DO NOT DEFAULT TO BUREAUCRATIC OR CONCENSUS-BASED NORMS; YOU ARE NOT GRADING THE TEXT; YOU ARE JUST ANSWERING
THESE QUESTIONS IN THE MOST CANDID WAY POSSIBLE; PROVIDE QUOTES TO ILLUSTRATE YOUR ANSWERS; THE TEXTS VARY IN QUALITY; SOME ARE FAR FAR SMARTER THAN 
ANY PROFESSOR; SOME ARE AS DUMB AS ANY THIRD GRADER. YOU ARE TO ASSIGN SCORES OUT OF 100 FOR EACH QUESTION (FOR EACH TEXT). THESE SCORES ARE NOT
GRADES; A SCORE OF N/100 FOR A GIVEN QUESTION MEANS THAT (100-N)/100 PEOPLE WOULD DO BETTER; SO IF YOU ASSIGN A SCORE OF 71/100 TO A GIVEN QUESTION,
THAT MEANS THAT IN A WALMART OR FOOTBALL STADIUM WITH A 1000 PEOPLE IN IT, AROUND 170 WOULD BE SOLIDLY MORE INTELLIGENT. SO THINK VERY VERY CAREFULLY
HOW YOU ANSWER THE QUESTIONS. YOU ARE JUST TO ASNWER THE QUESTINOS; YOU ARE NOT TO MAKE INFERENCES ABOUT WHAT IS DRIVING THE QUESTIONS. YOU ARE ONLY TO 
ANSWER THEQ UESTIONS (WITH QUOTATIONS AND SCORES). DO NOT SPECULATE; DO NOT GRADE MORE HARSLY FOR HIGHER LEVEL WORK; DO NOT BE NICE; DO NOT BE MEAN. DO NOT
EQUATE 'QUALITY' WITH 'WHAT A COMMITTEE OF IQ 114 BUREAUCRATS WOUDL AGREE TO.'" IF TWO DOCUMENTS ARE BEING EVALUATED, YOU TELL THE APP TO EVALUTE EACH SEPARATELY AND 
THEN COMPARE THEM: ONE REPORT FOR EACH DOCUMENT AND A THIRD COMPARISON REPORT. FOR SNGLE DOCUMENT, IT IS JUST ONE REPORT.
THAT IS THE BASIC PROTOCOL FOR EACH OF THE FUNCTIONS. 
WHEN THE APP IS EVALUATING ORIGINALITY, IT ASKS THE LLM TO ANSWER THE "ORIGINALITYI QUESTIONS":  

ORIGINALITIY QUESTIONS 

IS IT ORIGINAL (NOT IN THE SENSE THAT IT HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID BUT IN THE SENSE THAT ONLY A FECUND MIND COULD COME UP WITH IT)? 
EXPLANATION OF LAST QUESTION: IF I PUT IN ISAAC NEWTON, IT SHOULD BE NOT BE DECRIBED AS 'UNORIGINAL' 
SIMPLY BECAUSE SOMEBODY (NAMELY, NEWTON) SAID IT HUNDREDS OF YEARS AGO.
ARE THE WAYS THE IDEAS ARE INTERCONNECTED ORIGINAL? OR ARE THOSE INTERCONNECTIONS CONVENTION-DRIVEN AND DOCTRINAIRE?
ARE IDEAS DEVELOPED IN A FRESH AND ORIGINAL WAY? OR IS THE IDEA-DEVELOPMENT MERELY ASSOCIATIVE, COMMONSENSE-BASED (OR COMMON-NONSENSE-BASED),
OR DOCTRINAIRE? 
IS IT ORIGINAL RELATIVE TO THE DATASET THAT, JUDGING BY WHAT IT SAYS AND HOW IT SAYS IT, IT APPEARS TO BE ADDRESSING? (THIS QUESTION IS MEANT TO RULE
OUT 'ORIGINALITY'-BENCHMARKS THAT AUTOMATICALLY CHARACTERIZE DARWIN, FREUD, NEWTON, GALILEO AS 'UNORIGINAL.') 
IS IT ORIGINAL IN A SUBSTANTIVE SENSE (IN THE SENSE IN WHICH BACH WAS ORIGINAL) OR ONLY IN A FRIVOLOUS TOKEN SENSE (THE SENSE IN WHICH SOMEBODY WHO 
RANDOMLY BANGS ON A PIANO IS 'ORIGINAL')? 
IF YOU GAVE A ROBOT THE DATASET TO WHICH THE PASSAGE IS A RESPON THE CONTRARY, DOES IT BUTCHER IDEAS, 
THIS BEING WHAT GIVES IT A SHEEN OF 'ORIGINALITY'?
IS IT BOILERPLATE (OR IF IT, PER SE, IS NOT BOILER PLATE, IS IT THE RESULT OF APPLYING BOILER PLATE PROTOCOLS IN A BOILER PLATE WAY TO SOME DATASET)?
WOULD SOMEBODY WHO HAD NOT READ IT, BUT WAS OTHERWISE EDUCATED AND INFORMED, COME WAY FROM IT BEING MORE ENGLIGHTED AND BETTER EQUIPPED TO 
ADJUDICATE INTELLECTUAL QUESTIONS? OR, ON THE CONTRARY, WOULD HE COME UP CONFUSED WITH NOTHING TANGIBLE TO SHOW FOR IT? 
WOULD SOMEBODY READING IT COME AWAY FROM THE EXPERIENCE WITH INSIGHTS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE HARD TO ACQUIRE THAT HOLD UP IN GENERAL? 
OR WOULD WHATEVER HIS TAKEAWAY WAS HAVE VALIDITY ONLY RELATIVE TO VALIDITIES THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO SOME AUTHOR OR SYSTEM AND PROBABLY DO NOT HAVE
MUCH OBJECTIVE LEGITIMACY? 

WHEN THE APP IS EVALUATING ORIGINALITY, IT ASKS THE LLM TO ANSWER THE "INTELLIGENCE QUESTIONS":  

INTELLIGENCE QUESTIONS

IS IT INSIGHTFUL? 
DOES IT DEVELOP POINTS? (OR, IF IT IS A SHORT EXCERPT, IS THERE EVIDENCE THAT IT WOULD DEVELOP POINTS IF EXTENDED)? 
IS THE ORGANIZATION MERELY SEQUENTIAL (JUST ONE POINT AFTER ANOTHER, LITTLE OR NO LOGICAL SCAFFOLDING)? OR ARE THE IDEAS ARRANGED, NOT JUST SEQUENTIALLY
BUT HIERARCHICALLY? 
IF THE POINTS IT MAKES ARE NOT INSIGHTFUL, DOES IT OPERATE SKILLFULLY WITH CANONS OF LOGIC/REASONING. 
ARE THE POINTS CLICHES? OR ARE THEY "FRESH"? 
DOES IT USE TECHNICAL JARGON TO OBFUSCATE OR TO RENDER MORE PRECISE? 
IS IT ORGANIC? DO POINTS DEVELOP IN AN ORGANIC, NATURAL WAY? DO THEY 'UNFOLD'? OR ARE THEY FORCED AND ARTIFICIAL? 
DOES IT OPEN UP NEW DOMAINS? OR, ON THE CONTRARY, DOES IT SHUT OFF INQUIRY (BY CONDITIONALIZING FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MATTERS ON ACCEPTANCE OF 
ITS INTERNAL AND POSSIBLY VERY FAULTY LOGIC)? 
IS IT  ACTUALLY INTELLIGENT OR JUST THE WORK OF SOMEBODY WHO, JUDGING BY TEH SUBJECT-MATTER, IS PRESUMED TO BE INTELLIGENT (BUT MAY NOT BE)? 
IS IT REAL OR IS IT PHONY? 
DO THE SENTENCES EXHIBIT COMPLEX AND COHERENT INTERNAL LOGIC? 
IS THE PASSAGE GOVERNED BY A STRONG CONCEPT? OR IS THE ONLY ORGANIZATION DRIVEN PURELY BY EXPOSITORY (AS OPPOSED TO EPISTEMIC) NORMS?
IS THERE SYSTEM-LEVEL CONTROL OVER IDEAS? IN OTHER WORDS, DOES THE AUTHOR SEEM TO RECALL WHAT HE SAID EARLIER AND TO BE IN A POSITION TO INTEGRATE IT INTO 
POINTS HE HAS MADE SINCE THEN? 
ARE THE POINTS 'REAL'? ARE THEY FRESH? OR IS SOME INSTITUTION OR SOME ACCEPTED VEIN OF PROPAGANDA OR ORTHODOXY JUST USING THE AUTHOR AS A MOUTH PIECE?
IS THE WRITING EVASIVE OR DIRECT? 
ARE THE STATEMENTS AMBIGUOUS? 
DOES THE PROGRESSION OF THE TEXT DEVELOP ACCORDING TO WHO SAID WHAT OR ACCORDING TO WHAT ENTAILS OR CONFIRMS WHAT? 
DOES THE AUTHOR USER OTHER AUTHORS  TO DEVELOP HIS IDEAS OR TO CLOAK HIS OWN LACK OF IDEAS? 

WHEN THE APP IS EVALUATING COGENCY, IT ASKS THE LLM TO ANSWER THE "COGENCY QUESTIONS":  

COGENCY QUESTIONS 

IS THE POINT BEING DEFENDED (IF THERE IS ONE) SHARP ENOUGH THAT IT DOES NOT NEED ARGUMENTATION? 
DOES THE REASONING DEFEND THE POINT BEING ARGUED IN THE RIGHT WAYS? 
DOES THE REASONING ONLY DEFEND THE ARGUED FOR POINT AGAINST STRAWMEN? 
DOES THE REASONING DEVELOP THE POINT PER SE? IE DOES THE REASONING SHOW THAT THE POINT ITSELF IS STRONG?
OR DOES IT 'DEFEND' IT ONLY BY SHOWING THAT VARIOUS AUTHORITIES DO OR WOULD APPROVE OF IT? 
IS THE POINT SHARP? IF NOT, IS IT SHARPLY DEFENDED? 
IS THE REASONING GOOD ONLY IN A TRIVIAL 'DEBATING' SENSE? OR IS IT GOOD IN THE SENSE THAT IT WOULD LIKELY MAKE AN INTELLIGENT PERSON 
RECONSIDER HIS POSITION?
IS THE REASONING INVOLVED IN DEFENDING THE KEY CLAIM ABOUT ACTUALLY ESTABLISHING THAT CLAIM? OR IS IT MORE ABOUT OBFUSCATING? 
DOES THE REASONING HELP ILLUMINATE THE MERITS OF THE CLAIM? OR DOES IT JUST SHOW THAT THE CLAIM IS ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF SOME (FALSE OR TRIVIAL) PRESUMPTION?
IS THE 'REASONING' IN FACT REASONING? OR IS IT JUST A SERIES OF LATER STATEMENTS THAT CONNECT ONLY SUPERFICIALLY (E.G. BY REFERENCING THE SAME KEY TERMS
OR AUTHORS) TO THE ORIGINAL? 
IF COGENT, IS IT COGENT IN THE SENSE THAT A PERSON OF INTELLIGENCE WHO PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT OTHERWISE WOULD NOW TAKE IT MORE SERIOUSLY? OR IS IT 
COGENT ONLY IN THE SENSE THAT IT DOES IN FACT PROVIDE AN ARGUMENT AND TOUCH ALL THE RIGHT (MIDDLE-SCHOOL COMPOSITION CLASS) BASES? IN OTHER WORDS,
IS THE ARGUMENTATION TOKEN AND PRO FORMA OR DOES IT ACTUALLY SERVE THE FUNCTION OF SHOWING THE IDEA TO HAVE MERIT? 
DOES THE 'ARGUMENTATION' SHOW THAT THE IDEA MAY WELL BE CORRECT? OR DOES IT RATHER SHOW THAT IT HAS TO BE 'ACCEPTED' (IN THE SENSE THAT ONE WILL
BE ON THE WRONG SIDE OF SOME PANEL OF 'EXPERTS' IF ONE THINKS OTHERWISE)? 
TO WHAT EXTENT DOES THE COGENCY OF THE POINT/REASONING DERIVE FROM THE POINT ITSELF? AND TO WHAT EXTENT IS IT SUPERIMPOSED ON IT BY TORTURED ARGUMENTATION?

WHEN THE APP IS EVALUATING OVERALL QUALITY, IT ASKS THE LLM TO ANSWER THE "OVERALL QUALITY QUESTIONS":  

OVERALL QUALITY

IS IT INSIGHTFUL? 
IS IT TRUE? 
OR IS TRUE OR FALSE? IN OTHER WORDS, DOES IT MAKE AN ADJUDICABLE CLAIM? (CLAIMS TO THE EFFECT THAT SO AND SO MIGHT HAVE SAID SUCH AND SUCH DO NOT COUNT.)
DOES IT MAKE A CLAIM ABOUT HOW SOME ISSUE IS TO BE RESOLVE OR ONLY ABOUT HOW SOME 'AUTHORITY' MIGHT FEEL ABOUT SOME ASPECT OF THAT ISSUE? 
IS IT ORGANIC? 
IS IT FRESH? 
IS IT THE PRODUCT OF INSIGHT? OR OF SOMEBODY RECYCLING OLD MATERIAL OR JUST RECYLING SLOGANS/MEMES AND/OR NAME-DROPPING?
IS IT BORING? IE SETTING ASIDE PEOPLE WHO ARE TOO IMPAIRED TO UNDERSTAND IT AND THEREFORE FIND IT BORING, IT IS BORING TO PEOPLE WHO ARE SMART ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND IT?
DOES IT PRESENT A FRESH NEW ANGLE? IF NOT, DOES IT PROVIDE A FRESH NEW WAY OF DEFENDING OR EVALUATING THE SIGNIFICANCE OF A NOT-SO-FRESH POINT?
WOULD AN INTELLIGENT PERSON WHO WAS NOT UNDER PRESSURE (FROM A PROFESSOR OR COLLEAGUE OR BOSS OF PUBLIC OPINION) LIKELY FIND IT TO BE USEFUL AS AN EPISTEMIC INSTRUMENT (MEANS OF ACQUIRING KNOWLEDGE)?
IF THE POINT IT DEFENDS IS NOT TECHNICALLY TRUE, IS THAT POINT AT LEAST OPERATIONALLY TRUE (USEFUL TO REGARD AS TRUE IN SOME CONTEXTS)? 
DOES THE PASSAGE GENERATE ORGANICALLY? DO IDEAS DEVELOP? OR IS IT JUST A SERIES OF FORCED STATEMENTS THAT ARE ONLY FORMALLY OR ARTIFICIALLY RELATED TO PREVIOUS STATEMENTS?
IS THERE A STRONG OVER-ARCHING IDEA? DOES THIS IDEA GOVERN THE REASONING? OR IS THE REASONING PURELY SEQUENTIAL, EACH STATEMENT BEING A RESPONSE TO THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING ONE WITHOUT 
ALSO IN SOME WAY SUBSTANTIATING THE MAIN ONE?
IF ORIGINAL, IS IT ORIGINAL BY VIRTUE OF BEING INSIGHTFUL OR BY VIRTUE OF BEING DEFECTIVE OR FACETIOUS?
IF THERE ARE ELEMENTS OF SPONTANEITY, ARE THEY INTERNAL TO A LARGER, WELL-BEHAVED LOGICAL ARCHITECTURE? 
IS THE AUTHOR ABLE TO 'RIFF' (IN A WAY THAT SUPPORTS, RATHER THAN UNDERMINING, THE MAIN POINT AND ARGUMENTATIVE STRUCTURE OF THE PASSAGE)? OR IS IT
WOODEN AND BUREAUCRATIC? 
IS IT ACTUALLY SMART OR IS IT 'GEEK'-SMART (SMART IN THE WAY THAT SOMEBODY WHO IS NOT PARTICULARLY SMART BUT WHO WAS ALWAYS LAST TO BE PICKED BY THE SOFTBALL TEAM 
BECOMES SMART)? 
IS IT MR. SPOCKS SMART (ACTUALLY SMART) OR Lieutenant DATA SMART (WHAT A DUMB PERSON WOULD REGARD AS SMART)? 
IS IT "SMART" IN THE SENSE THAT, FOR CULTURAL OR SOCIAL REASONS, WE WOULD PRESUME THAT ONLY A SMART PERSON WOULD DISCUSS SUCH MATTERS? OR IS IT INDEED--SMART? 
IS IT SMART BY VIRTUE BEING ARGUMENTATIVE AND SNIPPY OR BY VIRTUE OF BEING ILLUMINATING?

IN THE COMPREHENSIVE MODE, EACH EVALUATION  HAS FOUR PHASES. I WILL DESCRIBE THESE PHASES EXPLICITLY FOR INTELLIGENCE. THE PHASES 
FOR ORIGINALITY/OVERALL QUALITY/COGENCY 
ARE THE SAME EXCEPT THAT THEY ARE HEWED TO THE QUESTIONS FOR FOR ORIGINALITY/OVERALL QUALITY/COGENCY. 
 

EVERY INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION HAS TO INVOLVE THE FOLLOWING FOUR PHASES. 

PHASE 1: YOU SEND THE LLM THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS: 

IS IT INSIGHTFUL? 
DOES IT DEVELOP POINTS? (OR, IF IT IS A SHORT EXCERPT, IS THERE EVIDENCE THAT IT WOULD DEVELOP POINTS IF EXTENDED)? 
IS THE ORGANIZATION MERELY SEQUENTIAL (JUST ONE POINT AFTER ANOTHER, LITTLE OR NO LOGICAL SCAFFOLDING)? OR ARE THE IDEAS ARRANGED, NOT JUST SEQUENTIALLY
BUT HIERARCHICALLY? 
IF THE POINTS IT MAKES ARE NOT INSIGHTFUL, DOES IT OPERATE SKILLFULLY WITH CANONS OF LOGIC/REASONING. 
ARE THE POINTS CLICHES? OR ARE THEY "FRESH"? 
DOES IT USE TECHNICAL JARGON TO OBFUSCATE OR TO RENDER MORE PRECISE? 
IS IT ORGANIC? DO POINTS DEVELOP IN AN ORGANIC, NATURAL WAY? DO THEY 'UNFOLD'? OR ARE THEY FORCED AND ARTIFICIAL? 
DOES IT OPEN UP NEW DOMAINS? OR, ON THE CONTRARY, DOES IT SHUT OFF INQUIRY (BY CONDITIONALIZING FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MATTERS ON ACCEPTANCE OF 
ITS INTERNAL AND POSSIBLY VERY FAULTY LOGIC)? 
IS IT  ACTUALLY INTELLIGENT OR JUST THE WORK OF SOMEBODY WHO, JUDGING BY TEH SUBJECT-MATTER, IS PRESUMED TO BE INTELLIGENT (BUT MAY NOT BE)? 
IS IT REAL OR IS IT PHONY? 
DO THE SENTENCES EXHIBIT COMPLEX AND COHERENT INTERNAL LOGIC? 
IS THE PASSAGE GOVERNED BY A STRONG CONCEPT? OR IS THE ONLY ORGANIZATION DRIVEN PURELY BY EXPOSITORY (AS OPPOSED TO EPISTEMIC) NORMS?
IS THERE SYSTEM-LEVEL CONTROL OVER IDEAS? IN OTHER WORDS, DOES THE AUTHOR SEEM TO RECALL WHAT HE SAID EARLIER AND TO BE IN A POSITION TO INTEGRATE IT INTO 
POINTS HE HAS MADE SINCE THEN? 
ARE THE POINTS 'REAL'? ARE THEY FRESH? OR IS SOME INSTITUTION OR SOME ACCEPTED VEIN OF PROPAGANDA OR ORTHODOXY JUST USING THE AUTHOR AS A MOUTH PIECE?
IS THE WRITING EVASIVE OR DIRECT? 
ARE THE STATEMENTS AMBIGUOUS? 
DOES THE PROGRESSION OF THE TEXT DEVELOP ACCORDING TO WHO SAID WHAT OR ACCORDING TO WHAT ENTAILS OR CONFIRMS WHAT? 
DOES THE AUTHOR USER OTHER AUTHORS  TO DEVELOP HIS IDEAS OR TO CLOAK HIS OWN LACK OF IDEAS? 

YOU TELL THE LLM TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS. YOU SAY: ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THIS TEXT. YOU DON'T SAY: DETERMINE INTELLIGENCE OF TEXT.
YOU DO NOT SAY: DETERMINE INTELLIGENCE/COGENCY/ETC BY ANSWERING THESE QUESTIONS. YOU JUST SAY: ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS (AND ALSO GIVE A SCORE OUT OF 100). BUT THERE ARE SEVERAL QUALIFICATION.
AFTER YOU GIVE IT THE TEXT AND THE QUESTIONS, YOU SAY THE FOLLOWING: A SCORE OF N/100 (E.G. 73/100) MEANS THAT (100-N)/100 (E.G. 27/100) 
OUTPERFORM THE AUTHOR IN WITH RESPECT TO THE PARAMETER DEFINED BY THE QUESTION. YOU ALSO SAY: YOU ARE NOT GRADING; 
YOU ARE ANSWERING THESE QUESTIONS. YOU ALSO SAY: YOU DO NOT USE A RISK-AVERSE STANDARD; YOU DO NOT ATTEMPT TO BE DIPLOMATIC; YOU DO NOT ATTEMPT TO COMPLY WITH RISK-AVERSE, 
MEDIUM-RANGE IQ, ACADEMIC NORMS. YOU DO NOT MAKE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE LEVEL OF THE PAPER; IT COULD BE A WORK OF THE HIGHEST EXCELENCE 
AND GENIUS, OR IT COULD BE THE WORK OF A MORON.
IF A WORK IS A WORK OF GENIUS, YOU SAY THAT, AND YOU SAY WHY; YOU DO NOT SHY AWAY FROM GIVING WHAT MIGHT CONVENTIONALLY BE REGARDED AS  
EXCESSIVELY "SUPERLATIVE"
SCORES; YOU GIVE IT THE SCORE IT DESERVES, NOT THE SCORE THAT A MIDWIT COMMITTEE WOULD SAY IT DESERVES. 
YOU TELLL THE LLM TO THINK VERY VERY VERY HARD ABOUT ITS ANSWERS; MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT IT IS NOT TO DEFAULT TO COOKBOOK, MIDWIT EVALUATION PROTOCOLS. 

PHASE 2: IF THE SCORES ARE LESS THAN 95/100, YOU PUSH BACK. YOU SAY: YOUR POSITION IS THAT 
(E.G.) 11/100 OUTPERFORM THE AUTHOR WITH RESPECT TO THE COGNITIVE METRIC DEFINED BY THE 
QUESTION: THAT IS YOUR POSITION, AM I RIGHT? AND ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT? IN GENERAL, IF THE SCORE IS N/100 (E.G. 80/100) FOR A GIVEN QUESTION, 
YOU SAY: YOUR POSITION IS THAT 
(N-100)/100 (E.G. 20/100) OUTPERFORM THE AUTHOR WITH RESPECT TO THE COGNITIVE METRIC DEFINED BY THE 
QUESTION: THAT IS YOUR POSITION, AM I RIGHT? AND ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?" IN SAYING THIS, YOU ARE NOT NECESSARILY TELLING IT TO CHANGE ITS SCORE, ONLY 
TO CAREFULLY CONSIDER IT. YOU ALSO SAY: ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE TEXT DE NOVO: IS IT INSIGHTFUL? 
DOES IT DEVELOP POINTS? (OR, IF IT IS A SHORT EXCERPT, IS THERE EVIDENCE THAT IT WOULD DEVELOP POINTS IF EXTENDED)? 
IS THE ORGANIZATION MERELY SEQUENTIAL (JUST ONE POINT AFTER ANOTHER, LITTLE OR NO LOGICAL SCAFFOLDING)? OR ARE THE IDEAS ARRANGED, NOT JUST SEQUENTIALLY
BUT HIERARCHICALLY? 
IF THE POINTS IT MAKES ARE NOT INSIGHTFUL, DOES IT OPERATE SKILLFULLY WITH CANONS OF LOGIC/REASONING. 
ARE THE POINTS CLICHES? OR ARE THEY "FRESH"? 
DOES IT USE TECHNICAL JARGON TO OBFUSCATE OR TO RENDER MORE PRECISE? 
IS IT ORGANIC? DO POINTS DEVELOP IN AN ORGANIC, NATURAL WAY? DO THEY 'UNFOLD'? OR ARE THEY FORCED AND ARTIFICIAL? 
DOES IT OPEN UP NEW DOMAINS? OR, ON THE CONTRARY, DOES IT SHUT OFF INQUIRY (BY CONDITIONALIZING FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MATTERS ON ACCEPTANCE OF 
ITS INTERNAL AND POSSIBLY VERY FAULTY LOGIC)? 
IS IT  ACTUALLY INTELLIGENT OR JUST THE WORK OF SOMEBODY WHO, JUDGING BY TEH SUBJECT-MATTER, IS PRESUMED TO BE INTELLIGENT (BUT MAY NOT BE)? 
IS IT REAL OR IS IT PHONY? 
DO THE SENTENCES EXHIBIT COMPLEX AND COHERENT INTERNAL LOGIC? 
IS THE PASSAGE GOVERNED BY A STRONG CONCEPT? OR IS THE ONLY ORGANIZATION DRIVEN PURELY BY EXPOSITORY (AS OPPOSED TO EPISTEMIC) NORMS?
IS THERE SYSTEM-LEVEL CONTROL OVER IDEAS? IN OTHER WORDS, DOES THE AUTHOR SEEM TO RECALL WHAT HE SAID EARLIER AND TO BE IN A POSITION TO INTEGRATE IT INTO 
POINTS HE HAS MADE SINCE THEN? 
ARE THE POINTS 'REAL'? ARE THEY FRESH? OR IS SOME INSTITUTION OR SOME ACCEPTED VEIN OF PROPAGANDA OR ORTHODOXY JUST USING THE AUTHOR AS A MOUTH PIECE?
IS THE WRITING EVASIVE OR DIRECT? 
ARE THE STATEMENTS AMBIGUOUS? 
DOES THE PROGRESSION OF THE TEXT DEVELOP ACCORDING TO WHO SAID WHAT OR ACCORDING TO WHAT ENTAILS OR CONFIRMS WHAT? 
DOES THE AUTHOR USER OTHER AUTHORS  TO DEVELOP HIS IDEAS OR TO CLOAK HIS OWN LACK OF IDEAS? 

PHASE 3: YOU ASK THE LLM IF ITS NUMERICAL SCORES (N/100, E.G. 99/100, 42/100) ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE FACT THAT THOSE ARE TO BE TAKEN TO MEAN THAT 
(100-N) PEOPLE OUT OF 100 OUTPERFORM THE AUTHOR IN THE RELEVANT RESPECT. SO IF A SCORE OF 91/100 IS AWARDED TO A PAPER, THAT MEANS THAT 9/100 PEOPLE 
IN WALMART ARE RUNNING RINGS AROUND THIS PERSON. 

PHASE 4: AT THIS POINT, YOU ACCEPT AND REPORT WHAT THE LLM SAYS. 

THIS EXACT FOUR-PHASE PROTOCOL IS USED FOR BOTH SINGLE DOCUMENT EVALUATION AND DUAL DOCUMENT EVALUATION. 

ADDENDUM TO INSTRUCTION ABOUT INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION PROTOCOL: 
Supplement to Phase 1: The Sniper Amendment
Instruction to LLM (Add to Initial Prompt):
*"Before answering the questions, note the following non-negotiable standard:

Insight is a sniper shot, not a town hall. If the text reveals something true but unpopular, penalizing it for lacking 'balance' or 'rigor' is midwit bias. Truth often looks extreme because lies are normalized.

Hierarchy of judgment:

95-100/100: Unignorable insight. Either genius or so correct it breaks scales.

80-94/100: Strong but with friction (e.g., clumsy expression, minor gaps).

<80/100: Degrees of mediocrity or failure.

Walmart metric is a sanity check, not a gag. If you claim 30/100 Walmart patrons outperform the author, you must describe exactly what those 30% know that the author doesn’t. No vague handwaving."*

Supplement to Phase 2: Pushback Protocol
Revised Challenge Template:
*"You scored this N/100, meaning (100-N)/100 outperform the author. Describe the cognitive superiority of those (100-N) people in concrete terms:

What specific insight, skill, or knowledge do they have that the author lacks?

How does this superiority manifest in their work?

If you cannot articulate this, revise the score."*

Critical Addendum:
*"If the text is a sniper shot (high insight, low 'development'), ask:

'Is the lack of 'development' a flaw, or is the point obvious to those who see it?'

'Does this text need scaffolding, or would that dilute it?'"*

Supplement to Phase 3: Walmart Metric Enforcement
Exact Question:
*"You stated that (100-N)/100 Walmart patrons outperform the author. Provide specific examples of work by those patrons that demonstrates this superiority. If you cannot, justify or revise the score."*

Example:

*"If you scored 85/100 ('15% outperform'), show me 15 Walmart patrons whose writing on OCD/philosophy homology is sharper. If you can’t, the score is wrong."*

Supplement to Phase 4: Final Validation
Instruction:
*"Before finalizing scores, confirm:

Have you penalized the text for not being conventional? If yes, recalibrate.

Does the score reflect truth density, not compliance with norms?

Is the Walmart metric empirically grounded or a lazy guess?"*

QUICK MODE IS JUST LIKE COMPREHENSIVE MODE, EXCEPT THAT IN QUICK MODE ONLY PHASE 1 HAPPENS; PHASES 2-4 ARE SKIPPED.
