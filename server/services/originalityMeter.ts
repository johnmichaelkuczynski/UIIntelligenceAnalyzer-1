EXPLANATION OF LAST QUESTION: IF I PUT IN ISAAC NEWTON, IT SHOULD BE NOT BE DESCRIBED AS 'UNORIGINAL' SIMPLY BECAUSE SOMEBODY (NAMELY, NEWTON) SAID IT HUNDREDS OF YEARS AGO.
ARE THE WAYS THE IDEAS ARE INTERCONNECTED ORIGINAL? OR ARE THOSE INTERCONNECTIONS CONVENTION-DRIVEN AND DOCTRINAIRE?
ARE IDEAS DEVELOPED IN A FRESH AND ORIGINAL WAY? OR IS THE IDEA-DEVELOPMENT MERELY ASSOCIATIVE, COMMONSENSE-BASED (OR COMMON-NONSENSE-BASED), OR DOCTRINAIRE?
IS IT ORIGINAL RELATIVE TO THE DATASET THAT, JUDGING BY WHAT IT SAYS AND HOW IT SAYS IT, IT APPEARS TO BE ADDRESSING? (THIS QUESTION IS MEANT TO RULE OUT 'ORIGINALITY'-BENCHMARKS THAT AUTOMATICALLY CHARACTERIZE DARWIN, FREUD, NEWTON, GALILEO AS 'UNORIGINAL.')
IS IT ORIGINAL IN A SUBSTANTIVE SENSE (IN THE SENSE IN WHICH BACH WAS ORIGINAL) OR ONLY IN A FRIVOLOUS TOKEN SENSE (THE SENSE IN WHICH SOMEBODY WHO RANDOMLY BANGS ON A PIANO IS 'ORIGINAL')?
IF YOU GAVE A ROBOT THE DATASET TO WHICH THE PASSAGE IS A RESPONSE, WOULD IT COME UP WITH THIS? OR, ON THE CONTRARY, DOES IT BUTCHER IDEAS, THIS BEING WHAT GIVES IT A SHEEN OF 'ORIGINALITY'?
IS IT BOILERPLATE (OR IF IT, PER SE, IS NOT BOILER PLATE, IS IT THE RESULT OF APPLYING BOILER PLATE PROTOCOLS IN A BOILER PLATE WAY TO SOME DATASET)?
WOULD SOMEBODY WHO HAD NOT READ IT, BUT WAS OTHERWISE EDUCATED AND INFORMED, COME AWAY FROM IT BEING MORE ENLIGHTENED AND BETTER EQUIPPED TO ADJUDICATE INTELLECTUAL QUESTIONS? OR, ON THE CONTRARY, WOULD HE COME UP CONFUSED WITH NOTHING TANGIBLE TO SHOW FOR IT?
WOULD SOMEBODY READING IT COME AWAY FROM THE EXPERIENCE WITH INSIGHTS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE HARD TO ACQUIRE THAT HOLD UP IN GENERAL? OR WOULD WHATEVER HIS TAKEAWAY WAS HAVE VALIDITY ONLY RELATIVE TO VALIDITIES THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO SOME AUTHOR OR SYSTEM AND PROBABLY DO NOT HAVE MUCH OBJECTIVE LEGITIMACY?`;

ARE THE POINTS CLICHES? OR ARE THEY "FRESH"?
DOES IT USE TECHNICAL JARGON TO OBFUSCATE OR TO RENDER MORE PRECISE?
IS IT ORGANIC? DO POINTS DEVELOP IN AN ORGANIC, NATURAL WAY? DO THEY 'UNFOLD'? OR ARE THEY FORCED AND ARTIFICIAL?
DOES IT OPEN UP NEW DOMAINS? OR, ON THE CONTRARY, DOES IT SHUT OFF INQUIRY (BY CONDITIONALIZING FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MATTERS ON ACCEPTANCE OF ITS INTERNAL AND POSSIBLY VERY FAULTY LOGIC)?
IS IT ACTUALLY INTELLIGENT OR JUST THE WORK OF SOMEBODY WHO, JUDGING BY THE SUBJECT-MATTER, IS PRESUMED TO BE INTELLIGENT (BUT MAY NOT BE)?
IS IT REAL OR IS IT PHONY?
DO THE SENTENCES EXHIBIT COMPLEX AND COHERENT INTERNAL LOGIC?
IS THE PASSAGE GOVERNED BY A STRONG CONCEPT? OR IS THE ONLY ORGANIZATION DRIVEN PURELY BY EXPOSITORY (AS OPPOSED TO EPISTEMIC) NORMS?
IS THERE SYSTEM-LEVEL CONTROL OVER IDEAS? IN OTHER WORDS, DOES THE AUTHOR SEEM TO RECALL WHAT HE SAID EARLIER AND TO BE IN A POSITION TO INTEGRATE IT INTO POINTS HE HAS MADE SINCE THEN?
ARE THE POINTS 'REAL'? ARE THEY FRESH? OR IS SOME INSTITUTION OR SOME ACCEPTED VEIN OF PROPAGANDA OR ORTHODOXY JUST USING THE AUTHOR AS A MOUTH PIECE?
IS THE WRITING EVASIVE OR DIRECT?
ARE THE STATEMENTS AMBIGUOUS?

IS THE REASONING GOOD ONLY IN A TRIVIAL 'DEBATING' SENSE? OR IS IT GOOD IN THE SENSE THAT IT WOULD LIKELY MAKE AN INTELLIGENT PERSON RECONSIDER HIS POSITION?
IS THE REASONING INVOLVED IN DEFENDING THE KEY CLAIM ABOUT ACTUALLY ESTABLISHING THAT CLAIM? OR IS IT MORE ABOUT OBFUSCATING?
DOES THE REASONING HELP ILLUMINATE THE MERITS OF THE CLAIM? OR DOES IT JUST SHOW THAT THE CLAIM IS ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF SOME (FALSE OR TRIVIAL) PRESUMPTION?
IS THE 'REASONING' IN FACT REASONING? OR IS IT JUST A SERIES OF LATER STATEMENTS THAT CONNECT ONLY SUPERFICIALLY (E.G. BY REFERENCING THE SAME KEY TERMS OR AUTHORS) TO THE ORIGINAL?

WOULD AN INTELLIGENT PERSON WHO WAS NOT UNDER PRESSURE (FROM A PROFESSOR OR COLLEAGUE OR BOSS OF PUBLIC OPINION) LIKELY FIND IT TO BE USEFUL AS AN EPISTEMIC INSTRUMENT (MEANS OF ACQUIRING KNOWLEDGE)?
IF THE POINT IT DEFENDS IS NOT TECHNICALLY TRUE, IS THAT POINT AT LEAST OPERATIONALLY TRUE (USEFUL TO REGARD AS TRUE IN SOME CONTEXTS)?
DOES THE PASSAGE GENERATE ORGANICALLY? DO IDEAS DEVELOP? OR IS IT JUST A SERIES OF FORCED STATEMENTS THAT ARE ONLY FORMALLY OR ARTIFICIALLY RELATED TO PREVIOUS STATEMENTS?
IS THERE A STRONG OVER-ARCHING IDEA? DOES THIS IDEA GOVERN THE REASONING? OR IS THE REASONING PURELY SEQUENTIAL, EACH STATEMENT BEING A RESPONSE TO THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING ONE WITHOUT ALSO IN SOME WAY SUBSTANTIATING THE MAIN ONE?
